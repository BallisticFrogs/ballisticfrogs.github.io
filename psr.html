			<h4>Background</h4>
		</header>
		<p>You play RSR-648b, a psychotic warship A.I., which wakes up somewhere in space after a very long hibernation. It needs to rebuild itself and will recycle anything it finds in order to return back to central command. In its madness, every unidentified moving object becomes a potential threat that must be crushed. Can you shoot and loot your way through alien territory and back to Earth? </p>
